## Product Video Generator

This is a simple learning project that shows how to create basic product videos with Python.

It combines a short product script, a few images, and generates a video with automatic voiceover and optional background music.

The goal of this project is to practice working with:

- Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology
- Image and video editing with Python
- Audio mixing and video exporting

It is **not** a full production tool — it is designed for **educational purposes**.

## Future Improvements

This project can be expanded by integrating AI agents to automate content creation.

📸 Automatically generate product images using AI image generators.

🔊 Automatically generate marketing scripts based on product descriptions.

📊 Build a fully automated product video creation pipeline with minimal human input.

These improvements would make the tool even more powerful for rapid content generation.

└── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
```

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv testenv
source testenv/bin/activate
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How to Use

1. Add your product images into the `images/` folder.
2. Write a simple script inside `scripts/product_script.txt`.
3. (Optional) Add background music to the `music/` folder.
4. Run the main script:

```bash
python3 create_video.py
```

5. Find the final video inside the `output/` folder.

---

## Notes

- Images should be in `.jpg` or `.png` format.
- Recommended image size is **1280x720** pixels.
- The video will automatically add 2 seconds intro and outro.
- No external API is needed — everything works locally.
